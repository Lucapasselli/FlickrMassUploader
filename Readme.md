I can’t guarantee that software will be free from error.
I'll take no responsibility for any damages including, but not limited to:
indirect or consequential damages, loss of data etc...
I'm not responsible if someone uses this software to damage others.
To prevent accidental data loss on your flickr account it's preferable to open an account only for backups.

A Special thanks to boncey for flikr4java development and the seleniumhq team!


IMPORTANT: I realized during my tests that flickr sometimes didn't return original video file also using browser, in that case it's impossible to me to download the original one. Remember that not original video files are cutted by Flickr at the third minute.

Beta 1.25  (05/07/2018)
Now photos and videos in Folder called NoBackupPhoto will never be backuped.
This implementation is to avoid duplicates when you restore and then rebackup photos from flicker that were not backuped with this tool (Flickr phots not backuped with this program are in fact restored in NoBackupPhoto folder).
This is also usefull if you don't want to upload some photos to your flickr account, with this implementation you can choose for example the entire photo directory and then move in NoBackupPhoto folder files that you don't want to backup online.
